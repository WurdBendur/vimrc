# vimrc

This is my <tt>.vimrc</tt> file. It's a mess, but it's here for my convenience. Some of the plugins are installed but not configured properly, like the markdown ones. I still haven't figured them out. Also there are unused themes listed because I was trying to find one that isn't terrible.

You don't really need a readme for this. It just goes in <tt>~/</tt> and then you have to tell vim-plug to install the plugins with <tt>:PlugInstall</tt>.
