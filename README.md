# vimrc

This is my <tt>.vimrc</tt> file. It's a mess, but it's here for my convenience. I've cleaned it up and commented most of it. It's probably not very helpful to anyone else, but have a look if you're curious.

You don't really need a readme for this. It just goes in <tt>~/</tt> and then you have to tell vim-plug to install the plugins with <tt>:PlugInstall</tt>.
